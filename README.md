## 🔍 Overview

AutoEDA is a lightweight yet powerful toolkit that streamlines data preprocessing for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning.

It automates routine cleaning tasks such as missing value treatment, type correction, and feature engineering, helping data scientists and analysts unlock insights faster and with less friction.

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ Seamless CSV upload & schema validation
* ✅ Null value imputation & type inference
* ✅ Smart duplicate detection & cleanup
* ✅ Feature extraction and transformation
* ✅ REST API support for integration
* ✅ Modern React + Vite frontend
* ✅ Dockerized deployment for easy setup

## 🧱 Project Architecture

### 🧠 Backend (Python)

* Modular design for cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing datasets
* Built with FastAPI for high-speed async REST APIs
* Easily extendable for custom ML workflows

### 🎨 Frontend (React + Vite)

* Sleek UI for uploading, previewing, and processing datasets
* Designed for responsiveness and ease-of-use
* Optional sections for documentation, help, and dataset history

### 🐳 Docker Support

* Docker & Docker Compose configuration for cross-platform deployment
* One command to launch the full app stack

## 📦 Requirements

* 🧑‍💻 Frontend: React.js, Vite
* 🐍 Backend: Python 3.x, FastAPI, Pandas
* 🐳 Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

> ⚠️ Remember to configure your `.gitignore` and environment variables!
